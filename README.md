# IOT2TANGLE Cmake based Entangled MAM Library

The following repo allows to build Entangled MAM examples to send and receive messages via the new MAM Protocol using Cmake instead of Bazel. The main reason to port from Bazel to Cmake is portability: Bazel does not perform very well on IoT devices (it does not even provides an installer for Raspberry Pi3B). 

## Why do we need this?
Since IOT2TANGLE requires us to build code to send data over MAM2 on different IoT devices, a build system that can run on SoCs such as ESP32, STM32, etc. was needed to compile the needed code. Cmake allows us to do so while keeping a clear relation with Entangled modifications. 

This repositorie reflects official Entangled 100% adding only the headers generated by Bazel and the CMakeLists.txt files to indicate dependencies and targets. Future modifications on Entangled should be easily absorved by adding new headers if needed and entries to the CMakesLists.txt


## Installation and usage
The following instructions cover Unix based systems (Linux/MacOS). Be sure to have [GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) ](https://gcc.gnu.org/) installed before running the following commands. 

```
git clone https://github.com/iot2tangle/cmake-mam.git
cd cmake-mam
cmake .
make
```
Once the build is done, you can seek for the send-msg and recv executables inside mam folder. 
To send a message (be sure to use nodes without SSL and do not include the http://): 

```
./send-msg node05.iotatoken.nl 16265 YOURSEED9YOURSEED9YOURSEED9YOURSEED9YOURSEED9YOURSEED9YOURSEED9YOURSEED9YOURSEED "Testing MAM2 sending script built with Cmake" "no"
```
If everything went well you should get an Address, Message ID and Bundle. 

```
Address: VSBDFUUIOYGYSYFAOCCUBFSJGZDIDLNMBCDHENGGYPKMCDZYGLZTBPVSTPQENVSRJXFMWWRZRLYRFUTZX 
Message ID: IONONZOXVGTNGVEOCXPUI
Bundle: SLMYHEVDFVLIRCWGJLGTJ9SZZEGNOFKUIHGOLGKVPBRBWXGVTCKPSGXK9RBXICCSSVPSJDYRPHLKSGEEYSLMYHEVDFVLIRCWGJLGTJ9SZZEGNOFKUIHGOLGKVPBRBWXGVTCKPSGXK9RBXICCSSVPSJDYRPHLKSGEEY
```
To fetch a given message we use the recv program and pass node, port and Bundle as arguments

```
./recv node05.iotatoken.nl 16265 SLMYHEVDFVLIRCWGJLGTJ9SZZEGNOFKUIHGOLGKVPBRBWXGVTCKPSGXK9RBXICCSSVPSJDYRPHLKSGEEYSLMYHEVDFVLIRCWGJLGTJ9SZZEGNOFKUIHGOLGKVPBRBWXGVTCKPSGXK9RBXICCSSVPSJDYRPHLKSGEEY
```

## Final comments
This is a work in progress and requires a lot of work to clean up unneeded dependencies being included by Bazel that have an impact on the binaries size. As we publish this code the send-msg script is 1.2MB (aroung 1MB when built optimized). Because some IoT devices have 1MB of Flash memory the size of this binaries needs to be reduced. 


## IOTA Entangled Monorepo
[![Build status](https://badge.buildkite.com/42ef0512276a270bd34cb0010fd641558b344dab4aa2225fba.svg)](https://buildkite.com/iota-foundation/entangled)

This is a monorepo containing all you need to get [[IOTA]](https://iota.org/) operating in C/C++

Containing IOTA components, models as well as cryptography primitives used in IOTA.

## Building

* Please use [Bazel](https://www.bazel.build/):
```shell
bazel test //...
```

## Developing Entangled
- Be sure to run `./tools/hooks/autohook.sh install` after initial checkout!
- Pass `-c dbg` for building with debug symbols.

### Tools required for running git commit hook
- buildifier
- clang-format

### Buildifier
Buildifier can be installed with `bazel` or `go`

#### Install with go
1. change directory to `$GOPATH`
2. run `$ go get github.com/bazelbuild/buildtools/buildifier`
   The executable file will be located under `$GOPATH/bin`
3. make a soft link for global usage, run
   `$ sudo ln -s $HOME/go/bin/buildifier /usr/bin/buildifier`

#### Install with bazel
1. clone `bazelbuild/buildtools` repository
   `$ git clone https://github.com/bazelbuild/buildtools.git`
2. change directory to `buildtools`
3. build it with bazel command, `$ bazel build //buildifier`
   The executable file will be located under `path/to/buildtools/bazel-bin`
4. make a soft link

### clang-format
clang-format can be installed by command:
- Debian/Ubuntu based: `$ sudo apt-get install clang-format`
- OSX: `$ brew install clang-format`
